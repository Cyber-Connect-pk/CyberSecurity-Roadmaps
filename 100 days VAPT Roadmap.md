* **Kali Linux:** Primary attack OS.
* **Vulnerable Apps:** DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web App), OWASP Juice Shop, bWAPP.

### **Web Analysis (The Big Four)**

1. **Burp Suite:** Intercepting proxy and vulnerability scanner.
2. **Nmap:** Network discovery and security auditing.
3. **Metasploit:** Exploitation framework.
4. **Nuclei:** Template-based vulnerability scanning.

### **Reporting & Standards**
